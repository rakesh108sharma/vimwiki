# Fiene's 10 [ROT](ROT.md) for the endgame

1. To win without pawns you must be at least a rook or two pieces ahead.

2. The king must be active in the endgame.

3. Passed pawns must be pushed.

4. The easiest endings to win are pure pawn endings.

5. If you are only one pawn ahead, exchange pieces, but not pawns.

6. Do not place your pawns on the same color as your bishop.

7. A bishop is better than a knight in all but blocked pawn positions.

8. It is worth giving up a pawn to get a rook on the seventh rank.

9. Rooks belong behind passed pawns.

10. Blockade passed pawns with the king.
