## piece activuty
piece activity == most important rule

## calculation of piece movement
=> is a 2 factor evaluation
| quantitative       | qualitative        |
| quantity of pieces | activity of pieces |

## Steinitz & Lasker
The primary strategic goal in chess is to *increase the activity of your
pieces*.  
for that: develop ALL your fieces forward and as close to the center as
possible.  

### how can I accomplish my overall goal?
1. increase piece activity!
2. overwhelm the opponent!
3. win material OR deliver checkmate!

### 16 strategic elements theory

## 4 specific rules
1. centralization
2. improve your least active piece
3. attack!
4. *chase back* OR *trade* opponent's pieces *on your side* of the board

## 4 part thought process
1. opponents plan          (try to guess/understand)
2. general strategy        (then come up with a plan)
   (candidate moves)
3. calculation
4. blundercheck

## SUMMARY
### opening
--> resolves around the *least active piece*
1. develop minor pieces  
   - knight & bishop
   - 1-2 pawns
2. castle & connect your rooks
3. develop the queen last

### middlegame
(shift in thinking)
**start an attack:**
1. centralization
2. attack
3. least active piece
4. trade opponent's piece

>weakness:
>is a pawn or squares not protected by other pawns.
|--> mostly on 5th, 6th or 7th rank.

### endgame
**all about pawns**

2 main objectives:
  1. attack opponent's pawns
  2. promote passed pawns

**the king is key**

### pieces
#### king


#### queen

#### rook

#### bishop

#### knight

#### pawn
