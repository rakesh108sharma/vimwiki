## shutterspeed  

### shutterspeed for non-moving objects 
1. x = focal-length * crop-factor
2. shutterspeed = 1 / x  

### shutterspeed for moving objects  
1/500    slow movement
1/1000   moving children/animals, sports, fast cars
1/2000   fast moving birds


## focus points
- one focus point:
    - good for still photografy; object isn't moving
    - too many focus points would confuse the camera
- multiple focus points:
    - for moving targets
- pre-focus:
    - if you know where the action is going to happen you can take focus before


## metering mode  
- evaluative:
    - if the whole picture is "important"
    - landscape
    - object is moving fast
    - object is black and white
- center:
    - object is moving fast
    - object is black and white
- partial:
    - object is priority
- spot:
    - object is priority
    - object is even-toned


## exposure  
one of three things (aperture, shutterspeed, ISO) is the most important, depending of what you want.
Start with that .. go to the less important  .. and regulate the least important (mostly ISO) last.  

- for non-moving objects, landscape:
    - aperture:
        - how much do you want in focus?
    - shutterspeed:
        - can be as low as possible, especially when on a tripod
    - ISO:
        - for fine tuning
- moving objects:
    - shutterspeed:
        - set according how fast your object is moving
        - and if you want to freeze the object or showing some movement
    - aperture:
        - let as much light in as possible
    - ISO:
        - for fine tuning
- for non-moving objects **AND** camera on tripod:
    - ISO:
        - as low as possible
    - aperture:
        - depending on how much focus I want
    - shutterspeed:
        - for fine tuning
