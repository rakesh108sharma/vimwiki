# opening tips
These tips are constantly updated by me.
Whenever I read/learn something new about the opening, I will try to assimilate
it and edit it in here.

1. control the center
   - king's pawn OR queen's pawn
   - make only 1-2 pawn movements

2. develop the minor pieces
   - knights before bishops
   - don't move pieces more than once
   - backup/defend your pieces more than once
   - don't bring the queen out too early
   - if possible, threaten something
   - don't exchange a developed piece for an undeveloped piece

3. castle early
   - protecting the king
   - preferrably kingside: 0-0

4. continue developping - now major pieces
   - put rooks on open files
   - dubble up your rooks

5. attack!
