[[CHESS]]
# Fine's [ROT](ROT.md) for the middlegame

1. Have all your moves fit into definite plans. Do not play aimlessly.

2. When you are ahead in material, exchange as many pieces as possible,
   especially queens.
   
3. Avoid doubled, isolated, and backward pawns.

4. In cramped positions free yourself with exchanges.

5. Do not expose your own king while the queens are still on the board.

6. All combinations are based on a double attack.

7. If your opponent has one or more pieces exposed, look for a combination.

8. To attack the king you must open a file (or less often a diagonal) to gain
   access for your heavy pieces (queen and rooks).
   
9. Centralize the action of all the pieces.

10. The best defense is a counter-attack.
