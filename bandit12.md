# Bandit - level 12

password: 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
solution: 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL 

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a
hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be
useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For
example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it
using mv (read the manpages!)

### Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv,
file

### Helpful Reading Material
Hex dump on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump)
