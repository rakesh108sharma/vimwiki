## Silman's thinking process for non beginners:

1. Figure out the positive and negative imbalances for both sides.

2. Figure out the side of the board you wish to play on (queenside, center, or
   kingside).
   
3. Find all the candidate moves that allow your side to make use of a major
   imbalance, or a series of imbalances. A candidate move should always be
   directed at your position's imbalances unless you're forced to play a
   purely defense move.
   
4. Finally, calculate the candidate moves you've chosen.
