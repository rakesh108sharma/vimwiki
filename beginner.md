2. Force.
3. Mobility/Space.

## the move selection process
1. Plan.
2. Checklist.
3. Evaluate.
4. Repeat for all candidate moves.
5. Select the best.

### checklist

1. King Safety.
   This includes looking at every check you have, and every check your opponent
   has. Are those forced mate? Are those checks defended? Keep any such moves in
   mind during the next steps.   
1.5 Queen Safety.
    This can be added if desired, but it should get consumed in the A/D network step.  
2. Attack/Defense Network.
   Construct the attack/defense network for the entire board. Every attack and
   defense, whether direct or indirect, needs to be included. The attack and
   defense count must be made in every case. If there is an imbalance in the
   count or one of the exchanges rules-of-thumb apply, then keep any such move
   in mind during the next steps.   
3. Tactical win/loss?
   If you have a forced mate, or the exchange rules-of-thumb indicate a win, or
   you see some other tactical win, then take it so long as your King is safe.
   If these do not apply, but King Safety or the A/D network indicates loss,
   then apply the CPR or OCRAP acronyms to generate more candidates.   
4. Calculate. 
   Consider the opponent's best. Hopefully at this point there are only a few
   candidate moves because time constraints may not allow looking ahead for too many moves. 
   For those candidate moves, the following is done. Order them so that the most forcing
   are first. Mentally make the move, and then apply your thinking process
   again, but from the opposite side's point-of-view. Redo this checklist for
   the opponent's move. Always consider that the opponent will make the best
   move. Of course, your opponent may have several candidate moves to each of
   your candidates. Recurse on the move selection process, until you have your
   best move.   
   

## Silman's thinking process for beginners:
  
1. Develop all your pieces.
2. Use your pawns to gain space.
3. Use other rules-of-thumb for the opening.
4. Pay attention to the tactics.
