# exchange rules

1. Capturing for nothing gains force.  
   
2. Capturing a unit of equal or greater value does not loose force.  
   
3. An absolutely pinned unit is not a defender/attacker 
   unless the pinning unit releases the pin during the exchange.
   
4. The King cannot be counted as a defender 
   unless it can capture after all the attackers capture.
      
5. When there are multiple attackers and defenders 
   and the first capturing unit captures a unit of less value, 
   then you have to have more attackers than there are defenders to not lose force.
         
6. Both the attacker and defender have to carefully watch the order that the pieces capture. 
   You do not want to lose a higher value unit to a lower value unit. 
   This is usually done by playing the next capturing unit as the one with lowest value.
