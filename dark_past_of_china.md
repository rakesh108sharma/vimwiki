## notes  
- long game (60-70 years)
- name of *Tibet* changed:
    - not for now
    - but *long game* -> after 60 years people will not remember.
- the bease reason (china's) come from **FEAR**
- Main land China is between *Yellow River* (north) and the *Yang Tze* (south) -> Mandarin
- great wall != **walls**
- in the north of the border to Russia is Manchuria:
    - they're not chinese -> they're mongolians
- Tibet's downfall starts when spiritual and worldly leader becomes the same person:
    - 5th or 6th Dalai Lama
- chinese people have always preferred a powerfull *central* government to which 
  they surrender until that power colapses -> it's in their DNA
- china's **vision** -- Dr. Sun Yatsen:
    - 1905 book "how to conrol China:
        1. Nationalism (Chinese Version)
        2. controled democracy (with a powerful center)
        3. controled economy with welfarism -> socialism
    - 1922 book "International development of China" (PDF):
        - where the roads, trains and ports should be
        - take money from the west -> learn from the west -> become stronger than the west
        - plans how and what to colonize:
            - Manchuria
            - Mongolia
            - Tibet
            - Eastern Turkistan
            - Nepal
            - Bhutan
            - Sikkhim (India)
- the chinese idea of geography are 5 concentric rectangles (not a round globe):
    1. royal domain (center)
    2. princely domain (Han area)
    3. vassal states (have to be controled)
    4. barbarian allies
    5. savages (rest of world)
- 100 years of humiliation +- 1840 (opian wars) - 1949 (independence)
- Chinese dream -- to rule the world
- (telling lies -- "..we are a maritime power..") -> NOT
- 1969:
    - Mao reaches out to the US via the polish embassy
    - and prposed to be a counter weight to the Soviet Union
    - because China's economy was finished and people were dying due to the famine
    - Kissinger went secretely to China
    - -> US (and West) didn't trust Mao and refused the "offer"
- After Mao dies Deng Xiaoping meets Jimmy Carter and UNO:
    - China is no longer a cummunistic country, but
    - a capitalist country ruled by a comunistic party
    - (to become rich is not bad anamore)
- But with Xi Jinping everything goes back to maoism:
    - there is no communistic central leadership anymore **but**
    - Xi - like Mao - becomes the *only* leader who knows everything best
    - he brings China back to a similar situation of 1967
    - ..everything is going bad..
    - **BUT** the rest of Asia is not in the same situation anymore
    - many asian countries are strong or rising
- some problems of China:
    - desertification of the north
    - only 7-10% fertile land
    - nearly NO freshwater sources -> reason why Tibet is so important
- subversion of economy:
    - they do not want to destroy other economies but
    - want to control them by
    - being the sole producer of important parts needed by others for production
- internal security budget is **higher** than the defence budget:
    - social card system
    - surveillance
- there are many anti-CPC and anti-Xi protests
- Xi doesn't even fly within China but uses the bullet train:
    - shows that he does not trust his own people
