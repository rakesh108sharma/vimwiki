# sufficiant material for mate

In order to win the game you have to mate your opponent; which means you have to
have sufficient men with sufficient abilities to do that. To mate a lone King (a
King with no other men), you need at least

1) a Queen, or
2) a Rook, or
3) two Bishops on opposite colors, or
4) a Knight and a Bishop.

Having only two Knights is insufficient. A single Bishop is insufficient. If you
have a single pawn then whether you can mate will depend on whether you can
promote the pawn to a Queen.
